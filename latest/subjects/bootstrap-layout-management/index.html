## Default HTML layout

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a>]

The default layout of an HTML page is very simple: it's almost non-existant.

Elements on the page are displayed according to their default type:

- ![][block] **Block elements** (such as `<div>`, `<p>`, `<table>`) start a new "line" and are stack on one another.
- ![][inline] **Inline elements** (such as `<span>`, `<a>`, `<button>`) are placed one after another in the same "line".

> You can place inline elements inside block elements.

**This is called the flow of the page**.

<p class="center"><img class="shadow" src="images/default-structure.jpg" /></p>

---
### Altering the default layout

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#4">Default HTML layout</a>]

CSS offers a bunch of properties to alter this default behavior, allowing for more creative and custom page layouts.

> We won't see these properties in detail in this course.

- `display`: you can force an inline component to behave like a block element, and _vice-versa_, or use more diverse display rules.
- `float`: you can force-push an element to either the left-side or the right-side of the page. This pull the element out of the flow.
- `position`: you can force an element to a special position (_`fixed`, `absolute`, `relative`_), this can also pull it out of the flow.

Using these properties can be quite tedious, especially if you want something **stable and compatible** with all browsers.

### Advanced CSS layout systems

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#4">Default HTML layout</a>]

With **CSS3**, new layout systems have been added to the toolkit of frontend developers, offering them **easier, consistant and more powerful** ways of placing and displaying elements on the page.

**We won't see those systems here**, as it's not the purpose of the course, but if you wan't to read more about them _(which is a good idea)_, here are some resources:

- CSS Grid Layout:
  - [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide To Grid][grid-guide]

> The CSS Grid Layout is based on the same principles used by the CSS Grid system in Bootstrap

- CSS Flexbox Layout:
  - [Flexbox Froggy][froggy], a little game to start with Flexbox
  - [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide To Flexbox][flexbox-guide]

> Bootstrap has built its Grid System with Flexbox. You should read those resources in order to be more familiar with the basics principle of Flexbox, although it's not required.

## Grid Systems

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a>]

.grid-50[

A Grid System is a way of creating layouts that's been inherited from graphic designers.

The idea is quite simple: you divide the space at your disposal in **columns** (usually an even number), separated by a **gutter**.

When you place your elements on the layout, they **must** be as wide as one or more columns.


]
.grid-50[

<p><img src="images/grid-example.jpg" width="500px" /></p>


]
.grid-100[

> An element mustn't stop in the **middle of a column**. That would completely defeat the purpose of having a grid system in place.

> A Grid System only **constrain the width** of an element. Its height is still **calculated based on its content**.

## Bootstrap Grid System

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a>]

Bootstrap includes a grid system that is very easy to use and very flexible.

Here are some "rules" to follow for using the Grid System:

- The grid is divided in **12 columns maximum**, whatever's the screen width.
- You **don't have to use it everywhere** on your page. You can for example use it inside one `<div>` in particular, and completely leave it aside for the next one.
- It was built having **mobile and tablet in mind**, so it offers easy **responsivness** for your layouts.

To use this grid system in your layout, you have a dozen classes at your disposal.

---
### Creating rows

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a>]

Rows are the base of the gris system. Adding a `.row` class to an element set it up with the Bootstrap Grid System.

> To have proper spacing, it's advised to use this class on elements wrapped inside elements with the `.container` or `.container-fluid` class.

Let's add a row around the _Lists_ section in our `index.html` file:

```html
*<div class="row">
  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <div class="list-group">
    <!-- first list -->
  </div>
  <div class="list-group">
    <!-- second list -->
  </div>
*</div>
```

> It's usually a good practice to use a new `<div>` to define a new `.row`. This helps avoiding strange behaviors regarding padding and margin.

???

You'll see that everything inside the new row is **now wider than the rest of the content**. This is because the `.row` class **cancel** the `padding` of the `.container` class. Defining the column will **solve** the _problem_.

---
### Adding columns

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a>]

Now that we have defined a _column container_ (i.e. the `.row` element), next step is to define the width (in number of columns) of each element in the `.row`.

This is done by using a special set of classes: `.col-{column}`.

> Replace `{column}` with the desired column width, between `1` and `12`.

In our list example, we would like our `<h2>` title to span 12 columns...

```html
<h2 `class="col-12"`>Lists</h2>
```

... and both our lists to be half-width wide (that is span on 6 columns each):

```html
*<div class="col-6">
  <div class="list-group"><!-- first list --></div>
*</div>

*<div class="col-6">
  <div class="list-group"><!-- second list --></div>
*</div>
```

???

Here, we've wrapped our `<div class="list-group">` element with another `<div>` on which we applied the `.col-6` class. That's because its padding and margin is interferring with the `padding` and `margin` of the `.list-group` class.

> Generally, it's a good practice to add a new `<div>` element to define columns.

---
#### Column wrapping

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a> > <a href="#10">Adding columns</a>]

If you look closely at the previous example, you might see something apparently odd.

We have an `<h2>` that's **12 columns wide** and two `<div>` that are **both 6 columns wide**. That makes up a total of **24 columns** for the row.

> Didn't you say that a `.row` has a maximum of 12 columns?!

Indeed. But when the number of columns in a row is **more than 12**, Bootstrap will **wrap all elements** causing the excess on a **new 12-columns-wide line**.

> This is very useful! With this behavior, you **don't have to constantly calculate** the number of columns in a row.

> Just define **one** row, and add **as many columns as you want**; they will be properly placed and spaced.

<div class="live-example shadow">
  <div class="example-wrapper">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <div class="example-column"><code>.col-6</code></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <div class="example-column"><code>.col-3</code></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-2">
        <div class="example-column"><code>.col-2</code></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-4">
        <div class="example-column"><code>.col-4</code></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-5">
        <div class="example-column"><code>.col-5</code></div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-10">
        <div class="example-column"><code>.col-10</code></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Offseting columns

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a> > <a href="#10">Adding columns</a>]

Another grid functionnality offered by the Bootstrap Grid System is **offsetting columns**.

Let's say that we want the _Forms_ section and the _Buttons_ section of the `index.html` to be **on the same row**, with both a **5-columns width**, but the former **aligned to the left**, and the latter **aligned to the right**.

We would need to offset our _Color classes_ section by **2 columns** to achieve that (so that the total adds up to 12 columns).

This can be achieved with another set of classes named `.offset-{column}`:

> Again, replace `{column}` with the desired number of columns

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-5">
    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <div><!-- Buttons content --></div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-5 `offset-2`">
    <h2>Color classes</h2>
    <div><!-- Color classes content --></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Responsivness

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a>]

As said before, Bootstrap was build **with smartphones and tablets in mind**, and this is especially visible with the Grid System.

Until now, we have only used the `.col-{column}` set of classes to position our element on the grid.

But there is actually **4 additional sets of classes available**, each of them being applied when the user's screen (or window) has a **certain width**:

| Classe name         | Min Screen width |
| :------------------ | :--------------- |
| `.col-sm-{column}`  | 576px            |
| `.col-md-{column}`  | 768px            |
| `.col-lg-{column}`  | 992px            |
| `.col-xl-{column}`  | 1200px           |

> Using these classes you can dramatically alter the layout of your page, depending on the width of the screen it's rendered on.

> You can also use those screen size names to offset columns: `.offset-sm-{column}`, `.offset-md-{column}`, `.offset-lg-{column}`, `.offset-xl-{column}`.

---
#### Example

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a> > <a href="#13">Responsivness</a>]

To see by ourselves how this works, let's modify the `<p>`s in the _Color classes_ section.

Add these classes in the `class` attribute of all the `<p>`:

```html
<p class="... `col-6 col-sm-4 col-md-3 col-lg-2`"><!-- content --></p>
```

**What does this mean?**

- `.col-6` The content will be 6-column-wide by default
- `.col-sm-4` The content will be 4-column-wide on small screens
- `.col-md-3` The content will be 3-column-wide on middle screens
- `.col-lg-2` The content will be 2-column-wide on large screens

> Go ahead. Try to resize your browser (using the Developer Tools of Chrome) and see how the content behave.

---
#### What if..?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a> > <a href="#13">Responsivness</a>]

What if you want your `<p>`s to be **3-column-wide** for every screen width, except on **extra-small ones**, where they should be **6-column-wide**?

Maybe you would do something like this:

```html
<p class="... `col-6 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3 col-xl-3`"><!-- content --></p>
```

> You can see that we have a lot of redundancy: `col-xl-3`, `.col-lg-3`, `.col-md-3` and `.col-sm-3` all do basically the same thing.

Good news is: we can get rid of this redundancy.

> Each screen-dependant class is applied when the screen has the expected width **or is wider** (_unless you defined otherwise_).

In this case, doing this would have the same result:

```html
<p class="... `col-6 col-sm-3`"><!-- content --></p>
```

> Since we didn't define any behavior for `xl`, `lg` and `md` screen, Bootstrap will fallback to the closest one, which is `.col-sm-3`.

---
#### Flexibility

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a> > <a href="#13">Responsivness</a>]

You don't have to use all the classes **each time** you want to define how your element should behave.

- By default, any component inside a `.row` but **without column class** for the current screen-width will be **12-column-wide**.

- If you define only **one class**, say a `.col-sm-5`, the element will be **`5`-column-wide** for **small screens and wider**, and **12-column-wide** for all **smaller screens**.

- If you defined only **two classes**, say a `.col-sm-5` and a `.col-lg-2`, the element will be :
  - 12-column-wide for screens below `sm` width
  - 5-column-wide for `sm` and `md` screens
  - 2-column-wide for `lg` and `xl` screens

> Understanding all these behaviors will greatly help you build your layouts.

### Responsive utilities

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Bootstrap - Layout management</a> > <a href="#8">Bootstrap Grid System</a>]

Finally, you have the ability to alter the display of any HTML element based on the screen-width.

This can be done with the `.d-{width}-{value}` utility set.
- Replace `{width}` with one of the available screen sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg` or `xl`)
  > Remove it for a class that applies regardless of the screen size
- Replace `{value}` with the type of display to apply to the element for the specified screen size.
  _For example: `none` to hide the element, `inline` to display it inline or `block` to display it as a block._

  > See [the documentation][d-values] for the complete list of display values

Let's say we want our _Tables_ section to be displayed as a `block` on `sm` and wider screens, and not displayed at all for smaller screens:

```html
<div class="`d-none d-sm-block`">
  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">
    <!-- Table content -->
  </table>
</div>
```
