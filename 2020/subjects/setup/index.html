## Summary

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a>]

We will see what we need to install and setup for this course.

This material is part of the [Advanced Front-end Development](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-masrad-dfa) for the [Master of Advances Studies in Rapid Application Development](https://www.he-arc.ch/ingenierie/mas-rad-cas-dar).


**You will need**

- [Google Chrome][chrome] (recommended, any browser with developer tools will do)
- [Visual Studio Code][vscode] (recommended, although any editor could do)

**Recommended reading**

- [Command Line][cli]

## Node.js

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a>]



<p class='center'><img src='images/node-js-logo.png' width='40%' /></p>

Node.js is a JavaScript engine that you can install on your machine to execute JavaScript programs without using a browser.

It's primarily used to develop both backend web applications and tools.

During this course, we won't use it directly, but we will use tools that need Node.js to run.

---
### Install Node.js

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#3">Node.js</a>]

To install Node.js, go to the [official website][node-dl] and download the installer for the latest **LTS** version for your system, then **launch it**.

<p class='shadow center'><img src='images/node-dl.png' width='100%' /></p>

> If you want more information about Node.js, see [here][node-js].

---
### Check

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#3">Node.js</a>]

When you completed the installation, you can check that everything ran correctly by launching a **Terminal**.

In this terminal, type the following command:

```bash
$> node --version
```

> You should see in return the version number of your node installation (should be `v12.16.1` or above)

---
### NPM

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#3">Node.js</a>]

Tools and other useful utilities that require Node.js to run are bundled into **packages for Node.js** that other developers can install on their machine.

To manage those packages, every Node.js installation comes with **a dedicated tool** called `npm`, which stands for **N**ode **P**ackages **M**anager.

Every package that can be installed on your machine is available through the **npm repository**, which you can browse thanks to its [own officiel website][npmjs].

> If you want more information about `npm`, see [here][npm]

For now, we will install one of those useful tools, called `live-server`.

> Later on, we will use `npm` to install many more packages, and you probably will too for your final project

---
## Install `live-server`

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a>]

> We'll see later what this tool does.

Open your **Terminal** (if you closed it before), and type the following command:

```bash
$> npm install -g live-server
```

> `npm install` allows you to install one or more packages on your system.

You should see some activity in your screen, meaning that the package is being installed.

---
### Check

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#7">Install `live-server`</a>]

When the installation is complete and the screen stand still, you can **check** that the installation went OK by just typing:

```bash
$> live-server
```

Your browser should open a page at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

That page should return an error: **this is expected**.

---
## Create project directory

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a>]

A **project directory** is simply a directory where all files for a specific web site or web application are stored.

You will need a project directory for both **this course** and **the project** you'll have to deliver at the end.

Right now, create an empty directory called `dfa-course` somewhere on your filesystem.

> This `dfa-course` project folder is where we will put most of the examples and exercices that we will see in the course.
>
> Right now, it's completely empty.
>
> **Whenever we refer to** "your project" **in the slides, we are talking about this `dfa-course` directory**.

---
### Create `index.html`

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#9">Create project directory</a>]

Most (_if not all_) web project directories have an `index.html` file endpoint:

- In WebSite, this is the **landing page**.
- In WebApplication, this is the **page that loads the app**.

<hr>

For this `dfa-course`, we **provide** you with the **content** of your `index.html` page.

Go to [this page][index-gist], and **save it** at the root of your project directory, under the name `index.html`.

> Hit `Ctrl + S` while on the page to save it on your file system, or select all the text and copy-paste it on an empty new file.

---
## Access your project

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a>]

Now that your project has an `index.html` file, we can see what `live-server` is all about.

Open a terminal, and go to the root of your project directory:

```bash
$> cd path/to/your/project
```

Then, type the command `live-server`, which starts the tool:

```bash
$> live-server
```

Like the last time, your browser should open a new tab at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

But this time, you should see this:

<p class='shadow'><img src='images/without-bootstrap.jpg' width='100%' /></p>

### What does `live-server` do

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#11">Access your project</a>]

`live-server` is two things.

<hr>

**It's a simple Local Web Server.**

That means it can serve files contained in a directory, here the `index.html` file in your `dfa-course` directory, **as if they were provided through a distant server**.

> `live-server` expects an `index.html` file at the root of the directory. If it does not find one, it will display the content of the diretory.

<hr>

**It has Live-Reload.**

With Live-Reload, `live-server` is able to activly watch **all files** in the directory it's currently serving.

Whenever a **save** is detected **on one of these files**, it automatically **reloads the tab** to reflect those changes.

> For `live-server` to detect the changes, you **have to save the file**.

---
#### Let's see...

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a> > <a href="#11">Access your project</a> > <a href="#12">What does `live-server` do</a>]

> With `live-server` started and your project directory opened in your broswer...

Open `index.html` in your text editor (_if you closed it before_), and change this line...

```html
...
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
...
```

...to this line:

```html
...
<h1>Hello, Yverdon!</h1>
...
```

**Save** the file and **go back to the tab in your browser** to see that the changes have been detected and **applied**.

**Revert** the line to its previous state, **save again** and see how magically the web page has changed.

---
## (Optional) VS Code Live Share

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Course Setup</a>]

For those of you who are using or will use VS Code (which I personally recommand), I advise you to install at least the Live Share plugins expansion pack.

Live Share is a pack of additional plugins for VS Code that allow **a user to start a collaborating session** from VS Code, invite others to **collaborate with him in real-time** (very much like Google Docs does), and share local resources across the network.

It also provides **textual and voiced chat** for people in the same sharing session.

Considering the current Covid-19 situation, those Live Share features might come handy for **advanced distant support** later in the course (and espacially during the project).

To install Live Share, first install [VS Code][vscode], then [the dedicated Expansion Pack][live-share-pack].

> Note that you can [join a session event without VS Code][browser-live-share] (but not start one).
