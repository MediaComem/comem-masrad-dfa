## Summary

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a>]

The goal of this course is to discover concepts and tools to organize the front-end side of a web application and enrich the user interface/experience according to current good practices. You will:

- learn how to make good use of a CSS framework to build a responsive HTML user interface
- learn (or review) how to manipulate the DOM API with or without a library
- learn how to manage asynchronous communications with a Web API on the back end
- learn how the use of a framework does help to organize the front-end code of a single page application
- be introduced to frameworks that help you develop and build your web application for multiple devices

Everything starts from here: [https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-masrad-dfa][dfa-site]

## Course deliverable

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a>]

The final deliverable of this course is a complete frontend web application for a pre-existing API named **Travel Log**, which allow users to publish logs of their travels around the world to other users.

</p>

> The project can be developed by **one** or **two** people ; you'll define each group at a later time.

## Back end

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a>]

Your web application will make use of a REST web service backend that is already implemented and ready to be used.

[Travel Log API Documentation][travel-api]

> We'll see later on this course how to call and exploit those APIs

## Travel Log

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a>]

This idea is somewhat inspired by the [Trip feature of TripAdvisor][tripadvisor].

### Create a Trip

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a> > <a href="#5">Travel Log</a>]

This feature of TripAdvisor allows users to create trips (either to plan future trips or make a log during the trip), and add places to them.

Each trip as a description, a cover photo and each place of a trip can be commented by other users.

### Features requirements

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a> > <a href="#5">Travel Log</a>]

In your case, a Travel Log application must allow users to:

- **register a new account** and **log in/out** to the app
- **create a trip** with a title and a description
- **add places to a trip** at a specific location, with a title, description and picture
- **manages their created trips/places** (update/delete)
- **see a list of trips** and **access the details of a trip**, including the list of its places
- **see places on a map** for one or all trips and **see the details** of those places
- **filter places and/or trips** so as to see only some of them somewhere in the app
- **search places and/or trips** somewhere in the app
- **post comments** on places and **see comments** for them somewhere in the app

### Implementation requirements

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a> > <a href="#5">Travel Log</a>]

In addition to the features requirements, your app must:

- follow Angular best practices
- use at least the API related to your subject
- correctly handle asynchronous operations (callbacks, promises or observables)
- use HTML5 Geolocation API (e.g. to automatically center the map or place an issue/place on the map)
- use Leaflet/OpenLayers/MapBox to display a map and stuff on it

> You're free to add features to your app that are not listed on this slidedoc.
>
> They could add some bonus points to your grade, provided that they are correctly implemented and functionnal.
>
> Be advised that stuffing your app with a load of additionnal features without implementing the required ones is not a very good idea...

## Delivery

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)</a>]

Each person or group's GitHub repository will be cloned locally on **monday morning 31st of august** and will be evaluated as is.

- Only the **main** branch content will be evaluated. Don't forget to merge any development or feature branches before the deadline!
- If your application requires **environment files** that are not tracked in your repository, please provide them to [Mathias Oberson](mailto:mathias.oberson@squareservices.ch) by email on the deadline date.
- Your repository must contains a documentation (e.g. `README.md` file at the root of the repo) that:
  - Describe your overall development approach (problems, obstacles, solutions)
  - Presents your application (what does it do, how does it work, what are the features), like a user manual
  - Explains the choices your made while developing (did your follow any style guidelines? architectural principles? did you use other packages not seen during the cours? etc.)
