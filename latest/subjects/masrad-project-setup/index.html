# Project Setup

We will see what we need to do to setup our development environment.

This material is part of the [mobile development course](https://github.com/MediaComem/comem-devmobil) for [Media Engineering](https://heig-vd.ch/formations/bachelor/filieres/ingenierie-des-medias).


**You will need**

* [Google Chrome][chrome] (recommended, any browser with developer tools will do)
* [Sublime Text][sublime] (recommended, any code editor will do... **except Notepad**)

**Recommended reading**

* [Command Line][cli]

## Install Node.js

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a>]

Node.js is a tool that allows developping back-end application with JavaScript, which we will not do in this DFA course.

> We will need it to install a very useful tool.

To install Node.js, go to the [download page][node-dl], get the installer for your system and **launch it**.

<p class='shadow center'><img src='images/node-dl.jpg' width='100%' /></p>

> If you want more information about Node.js, see [here][node-js].

---
### Check

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a> > <a href="#2">Install Node.js</a>]

When you completed the installation, you can check that everything ran correctly by launching a **Terminal**.

In this terminal, type the following command:

```bash
$> node --version
```
> You should see in return the version number of your node installation (should be `v6.10.0`)

---
## Install `live-server`

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a>]

Node.js gives you another command that we are going to use: `npm`

`npm` stands for **N**ode **P**ackages **M**anager and is a tool you can use to download other useful tools, that could help you improve your development experience.

> If you want more information about `npm`, see [here][npm]

We will download **one of this tool**: `live-server`.

> We'll see later what this tool does.

Open your **Terminal** (if you closed it before), and type the following command:

```bash
$> npm install -g live-server
```
> You should see some activity in your screen, meaning that the package is being installed.

---
### Check

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a> > <a href="#4">Install `live-server`</a>]

When the installation is complete and the screen stand still, you can **check** that the installation went OK by typing:

```bash
$> live-server
```
Your browser should open a page at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

That page should return an error: **that's normal**.

---
## Create project directory

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a>]

A **project directory** is a simple directory where all the files for a specific WebSite or WebApplication are stored.

You will need a project directory for both **this course** and **the project** you'll have to deliver at the end.

Right now, create an empty directory called `dfa-course` somewhere on your filesystem.

> This `dfa-course` project folder is where we will put most of the examples and exercices that we will see in the course.
> 
> Right now, it's completely empty.
> 
> **Whenever we refer to** "your project" **in the slides, we are talking about this `dfa-course` directory**.

---
### Create `index.html`

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a> > <a href="#6">Create project directory</a>]

Most (*if not all*) web project directories have an `index.html` file endpoint:

* In WebSite, this is the **landing page**.
* In WebApplication, this is the **page that loads the app**.

----

For this `dfa-course`, we **provide** you with the **content** of your `index.html` page.

Go to [this page][index-gist], and **save it** at the root of your project directory, under the name `index.html`.

> Hit `Ctrl + S` while on the page to save it on your file system.

---
## Access your project

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a>]

Now that your project has an `index.html` file, we can see what `live-server` is all about.

Open a terminal, and go to your project directory:

```bash
$> cd path/to/your/project
```
Then, type the command that starts `live-server`:

```bash
$> live-server
```
Identically to the last time, your browser should open at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

But this time, you should see this:

<p class='shadow'><img src='images/without-bootstrap.jpg' width='100%' /></p>

### What does `live-server` do

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a> > <a href="#8">Access your project</a>]

`live-server` is two things.

----

**It's a simple Local Web Server.**

That means it can serve the files contained in a directory, here the `index.html` file in your `dfa-course` directory, **as if they were on a distant server**.

> `live-server` expects an `index.html` file at the root of the directory.

----

**It has Live-Reload.**

With Live-Reload, `live-server` is able to activly watch **all the files** in the directory it's serving.

Whenever it detects a **change on one of these files**, it automatically **reloads the webpage** to reflect those changes.

> For `live-server` to detect the changes, you **have to save the file**.

---
#### Let's see...

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Project Setup</a> > <a href="#8">Access your project</a> > <a href="#9">What does `live-server` do</a>]

With `live-server` started and your WebSite open in your broswer...

Open your `index.html` file in your text editor (*if you closed it before*), and change this line...

```html
...
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
...
```
...with this line:

```html
...
  <h1>Hello, Yverdon!</h1>
...
```
**Save** your file and **go to your browser** to see that the changes have been detected and **applied**.

**Revert** the line to its previous state, **save again** and see how magically the web page has changed.
