# MAS-RAD | CAS-DAR | Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)

The goal of this course is to discover concepts and tools to organize the front-end side of a web application and enrich the user interface/experience according to current good practices.

You will:

- learn how to make good use of a CSS framework to build a responsive HTML user interface
- learn (or review) how to manipulate the DOM API with or without a library
- learn how to manage asynchronous communications with a Web API on the back end
- learn how the use of a framework does help to organize the front-end code of a single page application
- be introduced to frameworks that help you develop and build your web application for multiple devices
