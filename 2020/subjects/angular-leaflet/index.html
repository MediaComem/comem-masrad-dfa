## Introduction

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

[Leaflet][leaflet] is a JavaScript library that provides an API for creating, displaying and manipulating maps in applications.

It's not usable as-is in an angular project, because it does not follow the "_Angular Way_".

Thus, you'll need to use a community created angular directive that embeds Leaflet: the [angular-leaflet-directive][ngld].

---
## Download the requisites

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

Even if you won't use it directly, you'll need to download the Leaflet library, since angular-leaflet relies on it.

To do this, use [any methods proposed by Leaflet][leaflet-dl].

> We recommand that you download the latest Leaflet version.

You'll get a `leaflet.zip` file, that you'll need to unzip in your project.

Do this in a `leaflet` directory, directly under your `assets` directory.

Once it's done, you'll then need to include both the `leaflet.js` and `leaflet.css` files in your `index.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/leaflet/leaflet.css" />
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/leaflet/leaflet.js"></script>
```

---
## Include the directive

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

You'll then need to download and include the files for the `angular-leaflet` directive.

To get the `.js` file, go to the GitHub repository, or download it from [there][ngld-dl].

Either way, you should place it in your `assets/js` directoty.

Then, don't forget to add the file in your `index.html` file

Be sure to add it **after the inclusion of both `angular` and `leaflet`!**

```html
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="assets/js/angular-leaflet-directive.min.js"
></script>
```

Finally, add the dependence in your app's dependencies.

```js
angular.module('app', [
  // Previous dependencies
  'leaflet-directive'`
]);
```

## Documentation

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]



**BEWARE!**

The documentation for `angular-leaflet-directive` is... [lacking][ngld-doc], to say the least.

This is a library that you'll need to learn by trying things and deciphering examples ([which are aplenty][ngld-ex]).

We will sometimes redirect you to the [Leaflet Documentation][leaflet-doc], but know that you won't be able to use it as-is with `angular-leaflet-directive`...

> **You've been warned.**

---
## Include the map

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

The `leaflet-directive` is, as its name implies, an angular directive that uses Leaflet to show the map on your page.

This directive is named `<leaflet>`, and accepts a bunch of attributes that will modify or extend its behavior (_you'll need a controller for that_).

The easiest way of showing a map is to just add the directive, adding it some `width` and `height`, either with CSS or HTML attributes:

```html
<!-- Somewhere in your template -->
<leaflet width="100%" height="480px"></leaflet>
```

> The displayed map will have basics behavior:

- Open Street Map baselayer
- Zoom, with:
  - +/- buttons controls
  - double-click
  - mouse scroll
- Paning (drag'n'drop)

---
## Change default behavior

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

> In the following examples, the controller for the directive has a `map` alias.

To change some default behavior of the map, create an object on your controller with the desired changes (**all are optionals**):

```js
map.defaults = {
  doubleClickZoom: false, // disable the double-click zoom
  scrollWheelZoom: false, // disable zooming with the scroll
  dragging: false, // disable moving the map with dragging it with the mouse
  minZoom: 10, // Limit the minimal zoom
  maxZoom: 16, // Limit the maximal zoom
  ...
}
```

> You can try some of the options [here][map-options]

Then bind this object to the `defaults` attribute of the directive:

```html
<leaflet [...] `defaults="map.defaults" `></leaflet>
```

---
## Center the map

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

You can change the default center and zoom of the displayed map.

In the controller, you'll need to declare an object like this one:

```js
map.center = {
  // These are the coordinates for the center of Yverdon-les-Bains
  lat: 46.778474,
  lng: 6.641183,
  zoom: 15, // This one is actually optional
};
```

> By default, `angular-leaflet` uses **latitude and longitude coordinates**.

Then, bind this `map.center` object to the `lf-center` attribute of the directive:

```html
<leaflet [...] `lf-center="map.center" `></leaflet>
```

---
## Add markers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

To add some markers on your map, declare an array of marker objects.

Each marker object needs, at minimum, `lat` and `lng` properties:

```js
map.markers = [
  {
    lat: 46.781547,
    lng: 6.640351,
  },
  {
    lat: 46.781058,
    lng: 6.647179,
  },
  {
    lat: 46.778246,
    lng: 6.64149,
  },
];
```

Then, bind this array to the `markers` attribute of the directive:

```html
<leaflet [...] `markers="map.markers" `></leaflet>
```

> You can add new marker objects in this `map.markers` array at anytime; they will be dynamically added to the map.

---
### Fix the default marker

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a> > <a href="#9">Add markers</a>]

When writing this subject, we stumble upon a bug where **the default icons where not showing**.

**If this happens to you**, copy/paste this code **before the definition** of your `map.markers`...

```js
var defaultIcon = {
  iconUrl: "assets/leaflet/images/marker-icon.png",
  shadowUrl: "assets/leaflet/images/marker-shadow.png",
  iconSize: [25, 41],
  iconAnchor: [12, 41],
  popupAnchor: [1, -34],
  tooltipAnchor: [16, -28],
  shadowSize: [41, 41],
};
```

...then, add this property to all your markers:

```js
{
  ...
  icon: defaultIcon
}
```

> We will see in more details what this do

---
### Personalize the markers icon

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a> > <a href="#9">Add markers</a>]

You can use your own marker icons in your map. For that, you can define an Icon object in your controller, listing the properties of your custom icon:

```js
var myIcon = {
  iconUrl: "images/myIcon.png", // The only one that's required
  iconSize: [38, 95], // [X, Y], in pixels
  iconAnchor: [22, 95], // The point that will match the coordinates
  shadowUrl: "images/myIconShadow.png", // if your icon has a shadow
  shadowSize: [50, 64], // see iconSize
  shadowAnchor: [5, 64], // see iconAnchor
};
```

> The list of all the properties for this object can be found [here][doc-icon]

Then, reference this object in your marker object, using the `icon` property:

```js
map.markers = [
  // Previous markers
  {
    lat: 46.779244,
    lng: 6.659402,
    `icon: myIcon`
  }
]
```

---
### Draggable Markers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a> > <a href="#9">Add markers</a>]

To make your marker movable on the map, add the `draggable` property:

```js
map.markers = [
  // Previous markers
  {
    lat: 46.779244,
    lng: 6.659402,
    icon: myIcon,
    `draggable: true`
  }
]
```

> Moving the marker will update its `lat` and `lng` properties' value

To react to the marker being moved, you can attach a listener to your controller's `$scope`:

```js
$scope.$on("leafletDirectiveMarker.dragend", function (event, args) {
  console.log(args.model); // Will give you the updated marker object
});
```

> Remember to add `$scope` to your controller's dependencies

---
## Events

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Angular Leaflet</a>]

Leaflet provides a quite extensive list of events to react to.

> By default, all fired events are logged in the console. That's convenient to find the name of the event to which we want to react.

To react to one event, add a listener to your controller's `$scope` with the `.$on()` method:

```js
$scope.$on("eventName", function (event, args) {
  // Do something
});
```

Here a list of the more perrtinent events:

- `leafletDirectiveMarker.dragend`: the user stops dragging a marker. Use `args.model` to access the updated marker.
- `leafletDirectiveMarker.click`: the user clicked on a marker. Use `args.model` to access the clicked marker.
- `leafletDirectiveMap.click`: the user clicked somewhere on the map. Use the `args.leafletEvent.latlng` object to access the coordinates of the clicked point.
