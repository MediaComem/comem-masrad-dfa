## What to do?

1. Create a new project directory in your file system (`bootstrap-practice`)
2. Download the [basic HTML template][bht] and save it as `index.html`
3. **Using only Bootstrap classes** (that is: no custom CSS neither in HTML `style` attributes, nor in dedicated `.css` files), **recreate the following page**.

> Click on the image to see it full-screen.

<a class="center" href="images/final-result.png" target="blank"><img src="images/final-result.png" class="shadow" width="50%" /></a>

> Try to have a result as faithful as possible compared to the example.

> Don't hesitate to ask for more details about some particular elements of the page if you can not deduce it from the image.

## How to approach it?

The steps could be:

1. Analyze very thoroughly the screenshot
2. Try and determine the major "sections" of the layout
3. Try and determine how you will use the grid system
4. Start by the navbar and footer
5. Follow this by creating the list
6. End by the "discussion zone"

## Custom CSS

**You don't have to add any additionnal CSS!**

This practice was only realised using Bootstrap classes. Try to do the same.

Yes, it could be sometimes easier to just write some custom classes and be done with it. But that would defeat the purpose of this practice ðŸ˜‰

- [Navbar][navbar]
- [List groups][lists]
